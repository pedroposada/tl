developed by Pedro Posada


INTRO
---------
This module implements MODULENAME_preprocess_hook() to execute or simply substitute the __NTF__ token with the National Toll Free number on a node of 
type landing_page. The porpuse of the module is to allow the webdesigner to easily update the NTF value by changing it in a the ntf field and not 
touching the layout of the content and content_bottom fields. This makes the work of the webdesigner a bit easier when creating many landing pages.

This module can be enabled in any website that contains content type with field called ntf, content and content_bottom.
This module has been tested using CCK fields.
