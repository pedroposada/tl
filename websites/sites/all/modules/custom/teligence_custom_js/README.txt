jQuery Cycle Plugin
-------------------
The jQuery Cycle plugin is comprised of two basic parts:
	1. Core logic for controlling a slideshow
	2. A plugin architecture to support a wide variety of transition effects
	   (including custom transition effects that you can write yourself).

------
jquery_cycle.js contains all of the slideshow logic and all of the 
predefined transition effects that I have developed (over two dozen effects).
Use this script if you want to choose from a variety of transition effects.
