NOTES:
-----------------
This module is intended for allowing communication between any web-site, back-ends and PAYPAL. 
The module implements DRUPAL API to communicate with PAYPAL API and TELIGENCE back-end API.
The module executes a number of calls to different APIs mentioned above. 
This module was designed to be installed on a separate instance of DRUPAL.
This module is not designed to work together with other custom or contributed modules.
There is a sample databse dump file to learn more details about the database structure.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------
To find out detailed transaction information check the pp_Logging table. This table should contain GET and POST parameters for every single transaction
between paypal and this module.


ERROR SCENARIOS:
----------------
DuplicateGUID - this or similiar to this message will show up in the URL of the failure page when 
comming back from paypal after paying.
Possible reasons are that when testing the ASU, the same email was used twice logging into PAYPAL.
Always make sure that you never use the same email twice in the PAYPAL logi screen when testing ASU.
